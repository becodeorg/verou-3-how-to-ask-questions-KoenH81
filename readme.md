Steps to ask a clear question:

- be clear about what you are trying to achieve.
    e.g. Explain what your code/function is trying to achieve.
- Make your question short, specific clear and grammatically.
- Explain which steps you already tried to solve the issue.
- Use the proper terminology when asking your question.
    e.g. There is a difference between bracket, square bracket and curly bracket.
